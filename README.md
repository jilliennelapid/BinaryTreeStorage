# BinaryTreeStorage
---
Project 2 from Data Structures (COP3415) in which we read command inputs from a `.txt` file (`in.txt`) to populate a **Binary Tree** and to run queries on the data.

The resulting output is displayed in the console and in an output `.txt` file (`out.txt`). An example of such output is included in this repository.
